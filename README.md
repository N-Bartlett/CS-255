The Driverpass project was an interesting one. They wanted an application for student drivers to conduct online learning as well as testing with the ability to schedule in person, in vehicle training with an instructor.

This was a great class for me because it really demonstrated the need to properly plan out a project and clearly define the users needs. I currently work as a teacher and the webpage we use for tracking grades, assigning tests, scheduling classes, etc. is pretty bad. There is one person developing/maintaining it and after taking this class I see why it is so bad. Requirements clearly haven't been well defined to him so he is just winging it and creating/changing what he thinks we want rather than what we're actually looking for. I'm going to take what I learned in this class to give him a system design document on what he needs to change/add to make the page the way all of the teachers want.

I cant really pick an individual thing that I would revise from my documents. If I were going to do a revision I would do a full pass over everything. There are lots of places where I could make improvements. I suppose my charts are all pretty weak and I would start there. I'm not very good with lucidchart and I feel like more practice with it would yield better more visualy appealing results.

As far as interperaeting user needs and implimenting them I read through the interview with the customer and thought about how I would impliment what they want technically. From there I was able to consider what would be required to make that happen. The biggest challenge at this stage is going from a non-technical concept to how it would be implimented on a computer. Visualizing a product in your head and figuring out how to make that happen in a computer is key to defining good requirements and design documents.
